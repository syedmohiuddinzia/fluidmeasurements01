# Fluids Measurement of a Mechanical Project
In this project four DS18B20 (digital temperature sensors), two Yf-s201 (flow sensors), and two HK1100C (pressure sensors) are used. This project reads and calculates measurements of a fluid in a metallic mechanical tube in required units.

## Requirements
1- Ardjuino Mega 2560 </br>
2- Programming Cable for Arduino Mega 2560 </br>
3- Laptop with Ardino IDE and Python3 Environment </br>
4- Four DS18B20 (digital temperature sensors) </br>
5- Two Yf-s201 (flow sensors) </br>
6- Two HK1100C (pressure sensors) </br>
7- Required mechanical hardware </br>
8- Required 3 core cables for extending sensors length </br>
