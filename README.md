# Fluids Measurement of a Mechanical Project
In this project four DS18B20 (digital temperature sensors), two Yf-s201 (flow sensors), and two HK1100C (pressure sensors) are used. This project reads and calculates measurements of a fluid in a metallic mechanical tube in required units.

## Requirements
-1 Ardjuino Mega 2560
-2 Programming Cable for Arduino Mega 2560
-3 Laptop with Ardino IDE and Python3 Environment
-4 Four DS18B20 (digital temperature sensors)
-5 Two Yf-s201 (flow sensors)
-6 Two HK1100C (pressure sensors)
-7 Required mechanical hardware
-8 Required 3 core cables for extending sensors length
